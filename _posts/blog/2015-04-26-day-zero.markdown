<b>Last night before the course</b> and I am pretty excited to get going.

The pre-course work has actually been a lot more involved than I expected which is great if not slightly intimidating - the major takeaway for me is that it has confirmed my decision that I really want to do this. Also, it has made me realise some of the difficulties I would have faced had I continued to try and teach myself without the support of a clear structure and, most importantly, lots of other people and teachers to talk to.

Anyway, I'm going to try and stick to a structure to avoid aimlessly rambling and to ensure this is as useful as possible.
Over time, I am going to try and jazz this up, but for now, I'll stick to lists.

****

What I Learnt

	Rspec and the pre-course tutorials were the main focus - starting to understand the benefits of taking a test-first approach and how that ties into my existing step-by-step problem solving approach
	More advanced hash mapping techniques where you iterate over a sub-set of key-value pairings to dynamically present much larger datasets >> the Roman Numerals converter on the Makers tutorial

****

What was difficult

	Spent far too long grappling with the challenges of the mathemtical inaccuracies of non-float integers which I eventually managed to figure out with this (.to_f).ceil)

****

What's the plan tomorrow

	Start Day 1 of the actual course and go from there...

Code of the day...

So I'm going to cheat as its not from today, but this was a challenge I found the other day on CodeWars.
JadenString >> capitalises every word in a string to mirror the Twitter style of Jaden Smith.

		"class String
			def toJadenCase(string)
				array = string.split(' ')
				jaden_array = []
				array.each do |x|
					jaden_array << x.capitalize
				end
				jaden_string = jaden_array.join(' ')
				return jaden_string
			end
		end"
