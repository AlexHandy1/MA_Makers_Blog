<b>So this will be </b> tihe first slightly extended blog entry that might survive the real thing.
<!--more-->

What do I want from this blog? - Build a reference point for important concepts I have learnt - Give myself an outlet to talk through things I am finding difficult - Log questions - Talk about my general experience of learning to code and building my tech skills

I like a good structure so ideally, I want to build a visually cool 2*2 which covers a daily summary of - What learnt? - What was challenging? - What can I change? - What else?

For today I am mainly just excited that I have stuck to trying to figure out these blogging templates and have found a more advanced one that I will start building out on the side and transfer over too.
