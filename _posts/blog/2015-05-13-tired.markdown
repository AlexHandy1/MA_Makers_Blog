###<b>Tired</b>

A little out of nowhere hit a bit of tiredness wall today.
Haven't been doing crazy late nights but guess the mental exertion is more wearing.
After confidence gained from yesterday today has felt like a bit of a reality check though have continued to marginally improve the battleships game and actually test it properly.

****

What I Learnt

* Sinata error handling and redirects - was able to set-up params[:error] to manage validation of names and redirect back into original request page and, slightly less elegantly, set a catch-all raise error that handled underlying system error raises and pushed back to a functioning part of the UI
* Cucumber - Having hated websteps I am now learning how powerful they can be if you take the time to write your feature and scenario tests correctly and map to existing library of pre-made tests. Important that you map your web paths in the paths.rb directory.

****

What was difficult

* Still testing with Cucumber, improved with websteps but the capybara required is not intuitive
* Speed of development, doing simple things seems to be taking a long time again

****

What's the plan tomorrow

* Quick refresh of progress today and then want to push on to more sophisticated Version 2 AND make it look prettier

****

Code of the day...

Boring but the error redirection using a param was probably one of the better insights of the day.

    if @name.empty?
      redirect '/game/new?error=name'
    else
      erb :game
    end
