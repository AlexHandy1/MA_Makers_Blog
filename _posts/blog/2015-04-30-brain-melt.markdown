<b>Brain Melt</b>

I don't think I have properly experienced such drastic mental exhaustion in one day until this current point.
Alarmingly, even writing this blog is proving extremely challenging and is about the only thing on my to-do list I feel up to completing.
Apparently this is a good sign as I have been sufficiently 'stretched', and generally the second day of the project went well, but need to figure out how to avoid such brain explosions in future.

****

What I Learnt

	Doubles - how to ensure you have proper encapsulation in your tests by essentially passing placeholder objects to tests
	Manipulating objects - figured out how to effectively define class attributes and methods to ensure can move around and access. Establishing variables as class attributes and building methods to act as interfaces definitely came to life today.

****

What was difficult

	Cross class and test method and attribute manipulation - whilst I think I made great strides in understanding, it is responsible for my current mental state
	Doubles (and the accompanying stubs, mocks and spies) need more work - can't get them to run entirely in my current boris-bikes program

****

What's the plan tomorrow

	Review what I figured out today and make sure can effectively recall it
	Push to the end of Boris-Bikes, fix doubles and try extending
	Get ready for the weekend challenges

****

Code of the day...

	Coming up with the @works status to pass around and control the releasing and returning of bikes in our program
