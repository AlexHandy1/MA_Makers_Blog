<b>Boris Begins</b>

So today we got our first proper project - Boris Bikes.
This involves building a basic system in ruby that mimicks the core features of the Boris Bikes in London (e.g. allow users to take a bike from a docking station).
Mainly, its been great to get into the detail of the first project and pairing today has been really enjoyable.
Starting to understand the process...

****

What I Learnt

	BDD - importance of Behaviour Driven Development as a framework to enable you to move from high-level customer user stories down to specific objects and features. Very interesting understanding how this links into your specific coding and testing style.
	Rspec - a real deep-dive here covering new syntax from predicate methods to one-liner syntax
	Class Interaction - for a while during the precourse I had been wanting to better understand how classes should be correctly structured and woven together to interact. Felt like today took a good step forwarding in understanding this.

****

What was difficult

	I will likely regret this on reflection but today was actually OK and I think I grasped most of the key concepts, particularly vs yesterday where I really struggling in the afternoon.
	Had a quick look ahead to further stages and its clear the training wheels or granular explanation on walkthroughs quickly get removed.

****

What's the plan tomorrow

	Continue through the stages of Boris Bikes with Anna - see how far we get...

****

Code of the day...

	No stand-outs today as it was a lot more structural than coming up with fancy code based solutions.
	That said expect(method).to be_whatever_boolean_method_test_you_fancy in predicate matchers was clever.
