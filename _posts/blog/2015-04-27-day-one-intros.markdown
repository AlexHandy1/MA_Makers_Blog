<b>So day one of the course is done.</b>

Given I hadn't had the chance to meet anyone pre-course it was mainly good to put some names to faces.
It became pretty clear early on that the main aim of today was to meet everyone and get comfortable with some of the key principles for how the next 12 weeks will be.

Still, there was some useful stuff already, enough to keep my fledging structure going...

****

What I Learnt

	I'm going to need to adapt and consciously think through how I learn things - the pyramid model from Knowledge, and Understanding to Applying and Analysing and ultimately Evaluating and Synthesizing is helpful
	Estimote is a pretty interesting company that have created beacons which essentially digitize objects (give wifi signal) and solve the issue of context for web and mobile applications when using location
	On a lower level, the way to capture the max values from a hash is to list the hash variable values (e.g. list.values) and turn apply the .max method. Works for min too.

****

What was difficult

	Not wanting to dive straight into more coding and the challenges - being patient and buying into the process

****

What's the plan tomorrow

	Start our first challenge, I think

****

Code of the day...

Not a huge amount to choose from today, but the below refers back to the hash solution I mentioned.

	"list.each do |day, price|
		sell_day = day if price == list.values.max
		buy_day = day if price == list.values.min

		sell_value = price if price  == list.values.max
		buy_value = price if price  == list.values.min
	end"
