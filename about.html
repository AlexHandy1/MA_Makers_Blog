            <h4>Alex Handy</h4>
            <p>Hey, welcome to my blog! </p>
            <p>I'm Alex and I'm going to be writing about my career U-turn; going from a city job in London to becoming a full time developer and ultimately starting my own business</p>
            <p>I am big into sport, so will follow pretty much anything which is probably the result of growing up as a tireless West Bromwich Albion fan. I will still try and play some sport myself, particularly tennis and snowsports, the latter as I try and relive my life before getting a “proper” job after university, where I was a ski/ snowboard instructor for a year.</p>
            <p>I also help run a charity called the African Innovation Prize (http://www.africaninnovationprize.org/). We run a business plan and training programme that helps develop university entrepreneurship in Rwanda and Burundi - if you want to find out more let me know.</p>
